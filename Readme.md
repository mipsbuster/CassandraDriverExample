# Cassandra Java 3.0 Examples

This is a simple example of using the Cassandra v3.x driver from Datastax. The current example uses the Object.Mapper to show an example of elliminating tombstones on insert when nulls exist.

In addition there are some classes which are just draft so please ignore for now.

Project is currently using Intelij..
